Firstly, connect all the 4 PC to a single switch.

Example of a network config: ifconfig p2p1 10.0.1.12 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 10.0.1.255

For our case, our redhat Linux system, someone changed the network script to an incorrect IP 
at the directory: /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

For exercise 2, these are the command for configuration we needed:
ifconfig 128.143.71.201 netmask 255.255.0.0  broadcast 128.143.0.255
ifconfig 128.143.71.21 netmask 255.255.255.0 broadcast 128.143.71.255
ifconfig 128.143.137.144 netmask 255.255.255.192 broadcast 128.143.137.255
ifconfig 128.143.137.32 netmask 255.255.255.192 broadcast 128.143.137.255

Example of a ping command for exercise 2: ping -c 5 128.143.137.144

Please check exercise 2 part d as we are unable to ping.
